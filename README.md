# Ufonet--The-Funniest-DDOS

Create your own botnet and enjoy it

For fans of botnets, I have developed this room where we will download our own zombie army botnet and attack a virtual machine on our own network.

INSTRUCTIONS:

IMPORTANT!! : You can do this room with the "Try Hack Me AttackBox" machine, only if you are a subscriber. If you are using a free account you have to use your own linux virtual machine.



Download the hacking tool

The first thing we have to do, is start the machine "Bouncer Store", attached in this task.

To download the tool, we must connect to the machine via ftp.

Open your linux attack machine and run a terminal. Copy paste the following commands in the terminal:



ftp ip;

(ip= ip of "Bouncer Store")

Introduce the user:

bouncer

Enter the password:

cyberbouncer

Download the simulator with the command:

get ufonet-master.zip

We can exit from ftp session with:

Ctl + D

Now we are in possession of the tool the next step is to install it in our linux attack machine:

The file is in zip format...

Unzip the tool: 

unzip ufonet-master.zip;

Move to the tool directory:

cd ufonet-master;

Install the tool and run its gui:


sudo python3 setup.py build && sudo python3 setup.py install && sudo apt install python3-scapy; 
sudo python3 ufonet --gui;

After the last command, the browser will automatically open with the ufonet page.


*If that doesn't happen, terminate the machine to reset it and start over from the beginning.
In the event that you are using your own attack machine and you cannot access the ufonet website, I leave you this link that could help you:

REMEMBER!! This looks like a game but it's not. This is UFONET a powerfull hacking tool. Do not use it for criminal purposes.

UFONet - is a tool designed to launch DDoS attacks against a target, using Open Redirect vectors on third party web applications, like botnet.

DDoS attacks are designed to overwhelm a bottleneck within the software or hardware on a blockchain node.  The primary ways to defend against them are to ensure that nodes have adequate storage, processing power, and network bandwidth and to build failsafes into the code.

In this case, to not do anything illegal, we are going to attack a virtual machine within our own network.
We can attack the "Bouncer Store" (the virtual machine attached in the task), now that we have downloaded everything we need from it, we don't mind knocking it out.


In the ufonet page click on: "Start a mothership"

Use the interactive menu to go to "Wormhole" > "Botnet"

Now to create a botnet we need to get the bots on board our mothership. We could create it ourselves, looking for bots on our own, but that would take time, luckily the "Ufonet" community can provide us with a complete crew.
In the "Download Botnet" section, leave the ip that comes by default and click on "TAKE IT!"
Scroll down the page, and you can see the process like in the terminal.
When the process finish, reload the page (ctrl+r)...

CONGRATULATIONS!! Now you have your own army, use it with caution.
